Things left to do:
- just have the new acceptor say hello to everyone instead of doing this
  silly two-hop greet
- implement RETRY to obtain missing commits; this will probably just be
  done through the SYNC protocol
- make request cache retrieves more robust; figure out who to ask that
  isn't the request originator
- lots and lots of error-handling
